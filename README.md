# ArtBook
My project that I developed with what I learned in the Android operating system.There are two activities in the application. 
The first activity shows the previously added data. By selecting "Add Art" from the top-right of the first activity, 
selecting the photo from the gallery and writing text in the new activity, you can save this data in the database. 
In the first activity, if you click on the data you wrote before, you can see the details and you can be directed to the internet.
